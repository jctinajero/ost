    <h3><strong>Hi %{staff.name},</strong></h3>
    <p>
        You or perhaps somebody you know has submitted a password reset
        request on your behalf for the helpdesk at %{url}.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you feel that this has been done in error. Delete and disregard
        this email. Your account is still secure and no one has been given
        access to it. It is not locked and your password has not been
        reset. Someone could have mistakenly entered your email address.
    </p>
    <p>
        Follow the link below to login to the help desk and change your
        password.
    </p>
    <p>
        %{reset_link}
